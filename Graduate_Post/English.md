Good morning, dear professors. I'm glad to be here for this interview. My name is Ding Zifeng. I'm 21 years old now, and I was born and raised in Chizhou, Anhui Province.

My undergraduate alma mater is Changan University. There I first majorded in road and bridge construction, and in the second semester when I was sophonore I switched my major to computer science. In the next following two years I make efforts to finish all the courses. And I'm pretty good at English and have read multiple original English books. Besides, I'm an arch linux user and enjoy programming a lot.

In my leisure time, I like to play guitar. In the first two years in university, I worked for the Institutional Student Union and planned many art activities. It helped me improve my communicative competence.

If I got a chance to study in ustc, I would spare no effort to do research of my major, build up systematic view of management and achieve self value.

And ... that's all. thank you!

## questions

### why do you switched to computer science ?

The first motivation is that I'm not quite interested in my previous major, road and bridge construction. And the second factor is very coincidental I think. When I was watching youtube one day, I watched some videos made by Luke Smith, a youtuber who makes videos about linux. And I was quite amazed and feel it is so cool that computer can be used this way. Then I installed linux on my computer and started to learn some basic programming myself. That was the time I realized my interst about computer and decided to switch to computer science.

### why do you attend graduate school ?

So it's been two years since I studied computer science. I make efforts to finish all the courses in computer science, but I still feel that my professional ability is inadequate. So I want to improve my ability further in the postgraduate phase.

### please introduce your hometown ?

I'm from qingyang, a small town at the foot of the JiuHua mountain. Just as its name hints, it's a beautiful place surronded by green hills and clear waters. And every year lots of visitors will come here to worship buddhism and visit the scenary. In a word, it's a lovely place and I love it very much.

### why did you apply for ustc ?

First of all, I've always heard the information about computer science in ustc. For example,
I'm an arch linux user and I know that the LUG (linux user group) in ustc is very outstanding
Besides, I always use the mirrow build by ustc and it do help me a lot when I study computer.

Besides, I kown the teachers in ustc are very good and I hope to learn from them and improve my
ability further in the graduate career.

What's more, I admire the liberal and democratic spirit spread by ustc a lot.

### What's your favorite course in university? Why?

My favorite course is Compiler Construction, because this course help me improve my understanding about many algorithm theories. Besides, I think all the theories and logical process presented in the course is extremly elegant. Those are the reasons why compiler construction is my favorite course.

### what is your greatest strength?

I think my greatest strength is that I would make efforts and take my own initiative to learn and study the things that I'm intersted in.

### What is your greatest weakness?

I think my greatest weakness is that sometimes I'm very careless. For example, I used to choose the worng course design and finally I failed to pass the course design.

### What is your greatest accomplishment so far?

I think my greatest accomplishment so far is that I managed to finish all the courses required by computer science degree and took the graduate exam in two years.
