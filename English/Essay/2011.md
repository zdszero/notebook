1. 艾伦的贡献在于他**研究了**我们公认的假说 —— 因为我们不是机器人，所以我们可以
控制自己的思想，并且揭露了这一假说错误的本质。

2. 我们在理智时可能抱有可以自控的幻想，但是事实上我们一直都面临着这样一个问题：
“我们为何不能让自己去实践或者实现一些事情”。

3. 这就说明了忽略那些需要帮助的人**是合理的**，剥削别人、上层人优越、底层人卑微
也是合理的。

4. 环境似乎是在激发我们的最大潜能，如果我们总是觉得命运不公，那么我们就不太可能
会付出努力去改变现状。

5. 积极的一面是 —— 我们认识到所有事情都取决于我们自己，那么我们就会有无限潜能。
过去我们是各种局限的专家，现在我们变成了可能性的权威。

Dear frirend:

I'm writing to recommend my favorite movie The Shawshank Redemption to you,
which I think will is beneficial to your life.

In the movie, the protagnist Shawshank is arrested for killing his wife, which
is wronged, and jailed in a very tight prison. No one has managed to escape the
prison before. Shawshank suffered a lot in the prison but never give up to any
unfairness that destiny impose on him. Finally, he manages to escape after
decades and get the truth of freedom in the process.

I'll appreciate it if you enjoy this movie and I believe you'll learn a lot from
this film. **I'm looking forward to your reply.**

As is potrayed in the picture, two visitors are chatting and eating happily on
the boat and cassualy throwing rubbish into the lake. The water they went by is
full of junks and heavily polluted. The picture illustrates that nowadays many
people are still lacking the awareness of enviromental protection, which should
be our responsibility.


**So what's the cause of such phonomenon. Many factors are accounting for this.**
First and foremost, the concept of enviromental protection has not **taken root**,
and many people don't think it's a big deal to throw rubbish anywhere. Besides,
the enviromental management system isn't so satisfying. For example, in some
places the implementation of some regislations isn't performed actually.

**From what has been discussed above, it is urgent to take some effective and
relative measures.** **In the first place, we should continue to conduct more
propaganda in communities and schools so as to let people realize the importance
of** protecting enviroment. **In the second place, more rules should be set and
carried out by the government to restrain** the conduction of destorying
enviroment.

I'll appreciate if everyone can endeavor to protect the enviroment. And I firmly
believe that our great efforts will help make a big difference.
