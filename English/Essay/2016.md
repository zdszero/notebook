1. 我们不需要学习如何保持心理健康，我们天生就会这项技能，正如我们的身体先天就会
愈合伤口和受伤的骨头。

2. 我们的心理健康不会真正地消失，正如躲在云朵之后的太阳，它可以短暂地被遮掩，
但是它也具有立即恢复的能力。

3. 心理健康让我们对那些身陷困难之中的人抱有同情心，并以善良对待那些痛苦的人，
无论他们是谁，我们都将付出无条件的爱。

4. 尽管心理健康是我们生活中的种种良药，但是它也会带你进入很多困难的选择，那是
十分正常的。

5. 正如你将预见的，了解心理健康是容易获得的并且相信它（**主语对不上**），
这会让我们放慢生活的步调并且快乐的享受生活。

4. 尽管心理健康是我们生活中的万能良药，但是它再也平常不过，因为当你需要做出艰难
决定时，都能感受到他的存在。（主语变换）

5. 你会慢慢知道，了解心理健康无处不在并且值得信任，**这使我们**能放慢生活节奏，
   幸福地享受当下的生活。

As is portrayed in the first picture, a mother is telling her son to pay
attention to study while she is watching TV. In the second picture, the parent
is studying along with his son. Simple as the pictures are, the meaning bebind
it is profound: parents should be a model to their children rather than only
make requests.

As a Chinese saying goes, you cannot impose what you don't want to do on others.
This works same in the family education. Family education always plays an
importtant role in various forms of education. The children's ethinical
standard, self-displine and so on are all deeply influenced by their parent's
behavior. For example, some children are pushed by their parents to comform to
some rules or achieve certain goals, but they never see their parents to do these
things. So they cannot understand why they should abide by their parent's
instructions and what advantage they can take from it. In contrast, if the
parents are willing to be a behavior model to their children, then their
children would be more likely to understand their parent's teaching.

Parents, as the children's best teacher, should behave like what they want their
children to be. The family education would be more successful if parents take an
initiative to set an example to their children.
