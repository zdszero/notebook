Dear professor,

  I'm glad to know that you are going to visit our city. And I want to recommend some famous tourist attractions
in our city to you.

  The primary attraction I'd like to cite is the HuangShan Mountain, which is the most beautiful mountain in China
from my perspective. It is said that the scenery in HuangShan is different in every season and every moment, which
I believe will leave you a deep impression. Besides, the old town of HuangShan is also a destination that cannot 
be missed. It is symbolic of the traditional Chinese culture and full of various beautiful old buildings.

  I'll appreciate if you find my suggestions useful. And I believe you'll have a great time when you visit our city.

  As is portrayed in the first picture, a boy is sitting on the chair and wondering that he owns such numerous books,
but he doesn't plan to read any book. While in the second picture, another boy is reading a book besides the table and
making resolutions that he is going to finish reading 20 books in this year. Simple as the pictures are, the meaning
behind them is profound: owning books is not equal to reading books.

  The essense of a book is the knowledge that is imparted in the text but not the body of the book. Many people may have
the illusion that if they own the book, they grasp the book. But that is just not the fact. It is meaningless that we buy
lots of books but never read them. Besides, **the deeper princinple conveyed in the two pictures is** that we should strive to
attain what we have promised. We will never succeed if we only talk but never take actions.

  I hope that everyone can turn their resolution into long-term practice. And I firmly believe that our efforts will help us
make a big difference in the future.
